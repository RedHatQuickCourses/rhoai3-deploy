:description: Replacing manual UI clicks with a reproducible infrastructure script.

*Click-Ops does not scale. GitOps does.*

In the previous modules, we selected the **Granite-4 Micro** model and calculated the tuning parameters (`max-model-len=8192`) required to make it run safely on our hardware.
Now, we must deploy it.

You *could* open the OpenShift AI Dashboard, click "Add Model Server," copy-paste arguments, and hope you didn't make a typo.
But what happens when you need to deploy 50 models? Or when you need to update the configuration across three clusters?

In this lab, we will deploy our tuned inference stack using a parameterized **Infrastructure-as-Code** script.

== Step 1: Get the Lab Materials

To begin, we need to acquire the automation scripts. We have packaged the entire "Serving Factory" into a Git repository.

. **Open your OpenShift Terminal.**
. **Clone the repository:**
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhoai3-deploy.git
----
. **Switch to the lab directory:**
+
[source,bash]
----
cd rhoai3-deploy
----

[IMPORTANT]
.Are you catching up?
====
If you skipped the previous labs, your environment might be empty (no MinIO, no Model weights).
Before proceeding, you must ensure the model is downloaded and the storage is configured.
**xref:fast-track.adoc[Click here to run the Fast Track Setup Script]** to get your environment ready in 2 minutes.
====

== Step 2: The Architecture

Our script (`deploy/deploy-serve.sh`) automates the creation of two critical Kubernetes Custom Resources (CRs) in the `model-deploy-lab` namespace:

1.  **The ServingRuntime (The Engine):**
    * Defines the *What* (vLLM image, port 8080).
    * Defines the *How* (Tuning arguments like `max-model-len`).
2.  **The InferenceService (The Workload):**
    * Binds the Engine to the Data Connection named `models` (Path: `granite4`).
    * Requests the specific hardware (1 NVIDIA GPU).

== Step 3: Inspect the Automation

It is designed to be idempotent—you can run it ten times, and it will simply ensure the state matches your intent.

.Key Configuration Block (deploy/deploy-serve.sh)
[source,bash]
----
NAMESPACE="model-deploy-lab"
MODEL_NAME="granite-4-micro"
MODEL_PATH="granite4" 
CONTEXT_LIMIT="8192"  # Tuned for Micro footprint
----

== Step 4: Execute the Deployment

. **Run the deployment script:**
+
[source,bash]
----
chmod u+x deploy/deploy-serve.sh
./deploy/deploy-serve.sh
----
. **Watch the Output:**
    * You will see it create the `ServingRuntime`.
    * You will see it create the `InferenceService`.
    * It will then enter a wait loop, checking the Kubernetes status until the model is fully loaded into GPU memory.

*Expected Result:*
`✅ SUCCESS: Model is Serving!`

== Step 5: Validate the Tuning

Let's prove that our tuning parameters actually applied.

. **Check the Pod Arguments:**
+
[source,bash]
----
oc get pod -l serving.kserve.io/inferenceservice=granite-4-micro \
  -n model-deploy-lab \
  -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.containers[0].args}'
----
* *Verify:* Look for `"--max-model-len=8192"`. If this is present, your "Safety Valve" is active.

. **Test the API:**
The script outputs a `curl` command. Run it to confirm the model is reasoning.
+
[source,bash]
----
# Get the URL dynamically
export URL=$(oc get inferenceservice granite-4-micro -n model-deploy-lab -o jsonpath='{.status.url}')

# Send a prompt
curl -k $URL/v1/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "granite-4-micro",
    "prompt": "Write a haiku about GitOps.",
    "max_tokens": 60
  }'
