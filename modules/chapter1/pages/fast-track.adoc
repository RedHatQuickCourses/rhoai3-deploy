:description: A utility script to bypass the Registry setup and jump straight to Model Serving.

[.lead]
*Did you skip The RHOAI Model Registry?*

If you want to jump straight to **Serving** without building the full Model Registry infrastructure, you can use the **Fast-Track Script**.

This utility automates the "grunt work" of the AI Engineer:
1.  Deploys a MinIO Object Store ("The Vault").
2.  Creates a Data Connection in OpenShift AI.
3.  Downloads a model (`granite-3.3-2b-instruct`) and places it in the vault (S3 storage).

[IMPORTANT]
.Ungated Models Only
====
This script only works with **Public/Ungated** models (like IBM Granite 4.0 or Qwen 2.5). 
It does not support gated models (like Llama 3) that require a Hugging Face Token.
====

== Running the Script

1.  Open your OpenShift Terminal.
2.  Navigate to the repository root.
3.  Execute the script:
+
[source,bash]
----
chmod u+x deploy/fast-track.sh
./deploy/fast-track.sh
----

== Verification

Once the script completes (look for `✅ SUCCESS`), verify the environment is ready for serving:

. **Check the Artifact:**
* Verify the model files exist in the bucket.
+
[source,bash]
----
oc rsh -n model-deploy-lab deployment/minio ls -l /data/models/granite3
