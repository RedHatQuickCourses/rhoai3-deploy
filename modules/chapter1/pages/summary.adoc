:description: Recap of the Enterprise Serving workflow and next steps for production.

*You have achieved model inference."*

At the start of this course, we identified the core problem:
*Downloading models to a laptop is easy. Serving them at scale, on budget, and without crashing production is hard.*

You have now built a governed **AI Serving Engine**. Let's review the engineering decisions you made to get here.

== The Journey Recap

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Phase | The Engineering Decision

| **1. Strategy**
| Instead of grabbing random models, you selected **granite-3.3-2b-instruct** from the **Red Hat AI Validated Repository**.
*Result:* You gained legal certainty (Apache 2.0) and performance predictability.

| **2. Architecture**
| Instead of guessing, you matched the hardware to the workload.
*Result:* You avoided deploying an FP16 model on incompatible hardware or over-provisioning an H100 for a tiny task.

| **3. Sizing**
| You performed the VRAM math: `(Weights * 1.2) + KV Cache`.
*Result:* You identified that the default 128k context window would crash your A10G GPU.

| **4. Tuning**
| You configured **vLLM** with `--max-model-len=16000`.
*Result:* You created a "Safety Valve" that prevents OOM errors under high load.

| **5. Operations**
| You abandoned the UI for a GitOps script (`deploy-model-yaml`) from the `rhoai3-deploy` repository.
*Result:* Your deployment is now reproducible, version-controlled, and ready for automation.

== Next Steps: Day 2 Operations

Serving the model is just Day 1. To run a true production platform, your next steps are:

 * **1. Observability:**
Configure **Prometheus** to scrape the vLLM metrics port (`8080`).

 * *Key Metric:* `vllm:num_requests_running` (Concurrency) and `vllm:gpu_cache_usage_perc` (Are we running out of KV Cache?).

* **2. Quantization:**
Explore the **Quantization Labs** (coming soon) to shrink your Granite-4 model to **INT8**.

 * *Goal:* Double your throughput on the same hardware.

*Congratulations. You are now ready to serve AI responsibly.*
