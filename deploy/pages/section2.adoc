:description: Step-by-step guide to deploying a model from the registry using llm-d for intelligent routing and KV cache off-loading.

[.lead]
*Theory is over. It is time to deploy intelligently.*

In this lab, you will take on the role of a **Platform Engineer**. You have a model registered in your private Model Registry (from the previous course). Your task is to deploy that model using **Distributed Inference with `llm-d`**, enabling intelligent routing and KV cache off-loading that maximizes GPU efficiency.

[IMPORTANT]
.Prerequisites
====
* **Model Ready:** You have a model ready to deploy (from your private registry, the public catalog, or Hugging Face). We will use `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` as an example.
* **Cluster Access:** You are logged into an OpenShift AI 3.0 cluster via terminal (`oc login`).
* **Permissions:** You have `cluster-admin` or sufficient namespace privileges.
* **Repository:** You have access to the deployment configurations (we will provide the YAML).
====

== Step 1: Foundation - Verify Prerequisites

Before deploying with `llm-d`, verify that your cluster has the required infrastructure components.

=== 1.1 Install the LeaderWorkerSet (LWS) Operator (Multi-Node & MoE Only)

[NOTE]
.When You Need LeaderWorkerSet
====
The LeaderWorkerSet Operator is **only required** for:
* **Multi-node deployments:** When your model is too large for a single node and requires sharding across multiple nodes.
* **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models:** When deploying MoE models that require expert parallelism across nodes.

For **single-node deployments** (most common use case), the LeaderWorkerSet Operator is **not required**. You can skip this step.
====

If you are deploying a multi-node or MoE model, install the LeaderWorkerSet Operator:

. **Install via OpenShift Console:**
+
1. Navigate to **Operators** → **OperatorHub**.
2. Search for **"Leader Worker Set"**.
3. Click **Install** and accept the defaults.
4. Wait for the operator to be **Installed** (Status: Succeeded).

. **Verify Installation:**
+
[source,bash]
----
oc get csv -n openshift-operators | grep leader-worker-set
----
+
*Expected Output:*
----
leader-worker-set-operator.v1.x.x    Succeeded
----

[NOTE]
.Single-Node Deployments
====
If you are deploying a standard model on a single node (the most common scenario), you can skip the LeaderWorkerSet installation and proceed directly to Step 1.2.
====

=== 1.2 Verify Gateway API Support

The Gateway API is required for intelligent routing. OpenShift AI 3.0 includes Gateway API support via Service Mesh or kGateway.

. **Check Gateway API CRDs:**
+
[source,bash]
----
oc get crd | grep gateway
----
+
*Expected Output:* You should see `httproutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io` and related CRDs.

[NOTE]
.If Gateway API is Not Available
====
If you do not see Gateway API CRDs, you may need to install OpenShift Service Mesh or kGateway. Consult your cluster administrator or the OpenShift AI 3.0 documentation.
====

== Step 2: Deploy Your Registered Model with llm-d

Now that the foundation is in place, you will deploy the model from your registry using the `llm-d` runtime. This enables intelligent routing and KV cache off-loading.

=== 2.1 Create the Project

. **Create a namespace for your deployment:**
+
[source,bash]
----
oc new-project my-llmd-deployment
----

=== 2.2 Deploy Using LLMInferenceService

The `LLMInferenceService` Custom Resource tells the OpenShift AI operator to deploy your model using the `llm-d` runtime with intelligent routing enabled.

. **Create the Deployment YAML:**
+
Save the following as `llm-inference-service.yaml`. This configuration:
* Deploys your model (supports Hugging Face, private registry, or S3 URIs).
* Enables the `llm-d` runtime with intelligent routing.
* Configures KV cache-aware scoring for optimal routing decisions.

[NOTE]
.Key Configuration: Intelligent Routing
====
The `scheduler` section configures the intelligent routing behavior:

* **`kv-cache-utilization-scorer`:** Routes requests to pods that already hold the relevant KV Cache (cache hits).
* **`prefix-cache-scorer`:** Routes requests based on prompt prefix matching, enabling even more efficient cache reuse.
* **`queue-scorer`:** Balances load by considering pod queue depth.

The weights (2, 2, 3) determine the relative importance of each scoring factor. Higher weight on `prefix-cache-scorer` prioritizes cache affinity.
====

. **Apply the Deployment:**
+
[source,bash]
----
oc apply -f llm-inference-service.yaml
----

. **Monitor the Deployment:**
+
[source,bash]
----
oc get llminferenceservice -n my-llmd-deployment -w
----
+
Wait for the status to show **Ready**. This may take several minutes as the model images are pulled and the pods initialize.

[NOTE]
.Status Check
====
The status may briefly show *Failed* in the dashboard while images pull.
Check the pods: `oc get pods -n my-llmd-deployment`
Wait for the `model` and `inference` pods to be `Running`.
====

=== 2.3 Verify the Intelligent Routing Components

Once the deployment is ready, verify that the intelligent routing components are running:

. **Check the Inference Scheduler:**
+
[source,bash]
----
oc get pods -n my-llmd-deployment -l component=inference-scheduler
----
+
*Expected Output:* You should see a pod named something like `qwen-registry-inference-scheduler-xxx` in `Running` status.

. **Check the vLLM Worker Pods:**
+
[source,bash]
----
oc get pods -n my-llmd-deployment -l component=vllm-worker
----
+
*Expected Output:* You should see vLLM worker pods in `Running` status.

. **Check the HTTPRoute:**
+
[source,bash]
----
oc get httproute -n my-llmd-deployment
----
+
*Expected Output:* You should see an HTTPRoute that points to the `openshift-ai-inference` gateway.

== Step 3: Expose and Test the Service

Now that your model is deployed with intelligent routing, you need to expose it and verify that routing decisions are being made correctly.

=== 3.1 Get the Inference URL

. **Retrieve the Gateway Address:**
+
[source,bash]
----
export INFERENCE_URL=$(oc get gateway openshift-ai-inference -n openshift-ingress -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}')
echo "Inference Endpoint: http://$INFERENCE_URL/my-llmd-deployment/qwen-registry/v1"
----

=== 3.2 Test Intelligent Routing (Cache Hit Verification)

We will prove that the scheduler is routing based on cache affinity by sending two requests: one "cold" (cache miss) and one "warm" (cache hit).

. **Step 1: The "Cold" Request (Baseline)**
+
Send a request with a unique system prompt. This will be a cache miss, requiring full Prefill computation.

[source,bash]
----
time curl -k -X POST "http://$INFERENCE_URL/my-llmd-deployment/qwen-registry/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant talking about OpenShift AI."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Explain Kubernetes in 50 words."}
    ]
  }'
----
+
*Note the `real` time from the output. This is your baseline (cache miss).*

. **Step 2: The "Warm" Request (Cache Hit)**
+
Send the **exact same** request immediately. The scheduler should recognize the prefix hash and route to the same pod, resulting in a cache hit.

[source,bash]
----
# Run the exact same command again
time curl -k -X POST "http://$INFERENCE_URL/my-llmd-deployment/qwen-registry/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant talking about OpenShift AI."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Explain Kubernetes in 50 words."}
    ]
  }'
----
+
*Compare the `real` time. The second request should be significantly faster (lower TTFT) due to the cache hit.*

[NOTE]
.Understanding the Results
====
* **First Request (Cold):** Requires Prefill computation. Higher latency, higher GPU usage.
* **Second Request (Warm):** Cache hit. Lower latency, lower GPU usage (only Decode phase).

This demonstrates the value of intelligent routing: you are avoiding expensive recomputation by routing to pods that already hold the context.
====

== Step 4: Observability - Verify Intelligent Routing

Validate your deployment using the OpenShift AI Dashboard metrics.

=== 4.1 Access the Metrics

1. Navigate to **OpenShift Console** → **Observe** → **Dashboards**.
2. Look for:
   * **Networking/Ingress Dashboard:** Shows request routing patterns.
   * **Prometheus Dashboard:** Shows custom metrics from `llm-d`.
   * **NVIDIA DCGM Exporter Dashboard:** Shows GPU utilization.

=== 4.2 Key Metrics to Monitor

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| **Business Goal** | **Prometheus Metric** | **What to Look For**

| **Prove Intelligent Routing**
| `vllm_llmd_kv_cache_hit_rate`
| **Your #1 ROI Metric.** After sending multiple requests, this should show cache hits (values > 0). A 90% hit rate means you are skipping expensive Prefill compute 90% of the time.

| **Prove Responsiveness**
| `vllm_llmd_time_to_first_token_seconds` (TTFT)
| The primary measure of perceived speed. Cache hits should show lower TTFT than cache misses.

| **Prove Throughput**
| `vllm_llmd_time_per_output_token_seconds` (TPOT)
| The "generation speed" metric. Should remain consistent regardless of cache state.

| **Prove Efficiency**
| `vllm_llmd_gpu_utilization_seconds`
| Confirms expensive GPUs are active and not idling. Should be high during active inference.
|===

== Mission Accomplished

You have successfully deployed a model from your private registry using **Distributed Inference with `llm-d`**. Your deployment now benefits from:

* **Intelligent Routing:** Requests are routed to pods based on cache affinity and load.
* **KV Cache Off-Loading:** Cache hits avoid expensive Prefill computation, reducing latency and cost.
* **Resource Optimization:** Every GPU cycle is used efficiently, maximizing ROI.

---
*Your model is now running intelligently. Next, let's ensure you can troubleshoot and maintain this deployment.*
